# Lending Club Case Study

A major online loan marketplace is offering personal, business, and medical procedure financing. The dataset available covers loan data issued between 2007 and 2011, providing a comprehensive view for analysis.

When a person applies for a loan, the company can either accept or reject the application. If the loan is accepted, there are three possible scenarios: 
fully paid, current (in the process of repayment), or charged-off (defaulted). 

The purpose of this project is to -

1. Use exploratory Data Analysis to identify risky loan applicants so that the loan default rate can be reduced
2. Understanding the driving factors behind loan defaults

## General Information
### Overview
This project centers on analysing loan data from a major online loan marketplace that offers various financing options, including personal, business, and medical procedure loans. By examining loan data issued between 2007 and 2011, the project aims to gain insights into applicant risk profiles and identify the main factors associated with loan defaults.

### Project Background
Loan defaults can significantly impact the financial health of lending institutions, affecting profitability and operational efficiency. Understanding the characteristics and behaviours that contribute to defaults is essential for developing effective risk assessment strategies. This project provides a platform for applying data analysis techniques to identify patterns and trends within loan data, contributing to a more accurate and data-driven lending process.

### Business Problem we're trying to solve
The project addresses a key business problem: reducing the loan default rate by accurately identifying high-risk applicants. By using exploratory data analysis (EDA) to pinpoint the factors that most commonly contribute to defaults, the project seeks to support the loan marketplace in making better-informed lending decisions, ultimately leading to improved risk management and financial stability.

### Dataset
The dataset includes comprehensive loan data from 2007 to 2011, capturing application outcomes (accepted or rejected) and detailing loan status for accepted applications, which fall into three categories: fully paid, current (in repayment), or charged-off (defaulted). The data shared is in csv file with 39717 rows and 111 columns

## Conclusions
1. *Credit Risk Factors*: High debt-to-income ratio, lower credit grades (D-G), and high credit utilization are strong indicators of default risk.  
2. *Verification Importance*: Borrowers with unverified income pose higher risks, yet they often receive lower interest rates.  
3. *Geographic Variance*: Default rates vary significantly by region, with some states (e.g., NE, NV) exhibiting higher risks.  
4. *Loan Purpose Impact*: Loans for debt consolidation and credit cards are more prone to defaults, requiring stricter approval criteria and monitoring.
